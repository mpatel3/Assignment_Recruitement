1. To Run the project you will going to require any local server. 
2. I have used http-server.
3. After cloning, cd to the directory and run `npm install -g http-server`.
    * Note: For this command to run proper you will going to require npm and node.
    * make sure they are installed.
4. After you installed http-server run `http-server -o` command to start your server.


**Features which are implemented**
1. Column Level Sorting
2. Ascending and Descending arrow based on Sorting
3. Page level Filtering
4. Pagination
5. Column Level Filtering
6. Implemented scenario : if one of the key's value is object - implemented using modal-popup.
    * Once you open page click on "Show more" to show pop-up.
7. Table is fully customizable and dynamic.
8. Table is bit responsive as well.
9. Used technology : Vanila JS and Bootstrap.


**Note:**
Column level filtering will going to work only for one column meaning if you type something in filter of column-1 and then you type something filter in column-2 then filter will not work properly. Currently working on the solution.
